1. Note that this folder contains system files like:
"font-ficons.js" that are not part from the icons pack itself. Do not erase this file!



2. When pack is updated put all new icons list css declarations from 
"ClientApp\src\ficons\style.css" 
in the 
"ClientApp\src\ficons\font-ficons.js" 
but keep in mind that every font icon code for example "\e90a" must include extra slash "\" symbol like "\\e90a". 
We use the backslash (\) escape character to prevent JavaScript from interpreting a quote as the end of the string.



3. Same Font Icons CSS Declaration List from "font-ficons.js" must be updated also in file "ClientApp\src\styles\_dragon-skin.js"
